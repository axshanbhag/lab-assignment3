#### The purpose of *meta* tags and how *div* tags help in organizing webpages:
- **Meta** tags provide metadata about the webpage, such as character encoding, author information, keywords, viewport and a description. This helps search engines analyze the content and ensures the webpage is properly displayed across all devices. The **div** tags help organize webpages into different sections like header, navigation, main content, and footer, which makes the framework manageable and easier to style with CSS.
